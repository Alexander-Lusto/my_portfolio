          The desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is something that runs deep within everyone, even though most people don't take the time to find someone who truly respects them. Its seems like people are just looking for someone to show them slighest amount of attention, settling for something much less than respect. I am conviced one of the best ways to help any relationship grow is showing respect.

          I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect? respect is showing someone extra special attention, or high regard, based on desire to show them how highly they are valued.
